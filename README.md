# Demo Puppet implementation

This repo contains a demonstration of a simple database installation. It uses the [`ora_profile`](https://forge.puppet.com/enterprisemodules/ora_profile) module to get a quick and easy start.

The name of the node indicates which version of Oracle will be installed in it i.e. db112 has version 11.2. This demo is ready for Puppet 4,5 and 6.
## Starting the nodes masterless

All nodes are available to test with Puppet masterless. To do so, add `ml-` for the name when using vagrant:

```
$ vagrant up <ml-db112|ml-db121|ml-db122|ml-db180|ml-db190>
```

## Starting the nodes with PE

You can also test with a Puppet Enterprise server. To do so, add `pe-` for the name when using vagrant:

```
$ vagrant up pe-dbmaster
$ vagrant up <pe-db112|pe-db121|pe-db122|pe-db180|pe-db190>
```

## ordering

You must always use the specified order:

1. master
2. <db112|db121|db122|db180|db190>

## Required software

The software must be placed in `modules/software/files`. It must contain the next files:

### Puppet Enterprise (Not needed when using masterless deployments)
- [puppet-enterprise-2018.1.3-el-7-x86_64.tar.gz (Extracted tar)](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-enterprise)

### Oracle Database version 18.0.0.0
- `LINUX.X64_180000_db_home.zip`

### Oracle Database version 12.2.0.1
- `linuxx64_12201_database.zip`
- `p6880880_121010_Linux-x86-64.zip` (Opatch version)

## Running the Windows demos

Since May 2019, our modules also support Windows. The demo is changed to run on windows too. because of Powershell security requirements, however, vagrant cannot do the whole Oracle/puppet setup. You must start Puppet from the machine itself. First step is to provision the system and get Puppet installed.

```
$ vagrant up --no-provision ml-db180
```

After this is finished, open the VirtualBox console and log i nto the Windows machine with the `Administrator` account. The password of the Vagrant box is `vagrant`. The start the Command Prompt and run Puppet from there:

```
$ puppet apply c:\vagrant\manifests\site.pp -t
```

This will start a normal Puppet run and install and manage Oracle.

### Required software

The software must be placed in `modules/software/files`. For the Oracle 18 database in windows, It must contain:

- `WINDOWS.X64_180000_db_home.zip`

and the Puppet agent for Windows:

- `puppet-agent-6.4.2-x64.msi`

## Common issues

- Sometimes Linux virtual machine hangs while ssh connection during executions of vagrant script. The way to fix it is log in to the machine, as root, and run dhclient.
